# Mind Reader Pseudocode Program

## Outline 
1. Pseudocode the problem in its entirety before you start coding
2. Use JavaScript to successfully show the transition from one view to the next view
3. Successfully show state management for each step of the single page app ("view" 1, 2, 3, ...)
    1. Only create a single index.html
    2. No need to refresh the page (manually or using JS)
    3. Update state using a variable that tells the computer what 'view' it is
    4.  Use functions to move forward a view, backward, reset to the first view, and display the correct view on load / after every state change
4. Use Icons of your choice, we recommend either Bootstrap Icons (best) or Font Awesome (second best) but feel free to find your own
5. All multiples of 9 should be the same symbol (this is important for the math gimmick to work)


## About 
[README](README.md)

We are going to break down our Mind Reader program into pseudocode. We'll start by detailing how the this program will write to the DOM.

Javascript has the ability to write, delete, and change html and css to our DOM, which would allow us to change elements on the page without refreshing the page.
